Javascript functions to check if a given array of credit cards are valid, return an array of invalid credit card numbers, and return the issuing companies of invalid credit card numbers
This is a project on the Codecademy Full Stack Developer course which took me some time completing (Christmas break is to blame!)
Where stuck I used chatGPT to understand the syntax and methods I could use. Feedback is welcomed
